/**
 * The prime numbers are not regularly spaced. For example from 2 to 3 the gap is 1. From 3 to 5 the gap is 2. From 7 to 11 it is 4. Between 2 and 50 we have the following pairs of 2-gaps primes: 3-5, 5-7, 11-13, 17-19, 29-31, 41-43
 *
 * A prime gap of length n is a run of n-1 consecutive composite numbers between two successive primes (see: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/* PrimeGaps.html).
